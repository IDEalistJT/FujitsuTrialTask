This project was made for Fujitsu Java Programming Trial Task 2024!

How to use the REST interface:
1) Run FujitsuTrialTaskApplication.main()
2) Run the application with parameters city and vehicleType on localhost in your browser of choice, for example with http://localhost:8080/delivery-fee?city=PÃ¤rnu&vehicleType=Bike

Currently no more convenient interface has been implemented.
